# Types

The standard used for `Typescript` is the following:

1. Every type should start with `T` e.g `TImage`.
2. Model types should have the same name as the factory e.g. `User`.
3. Components should define the prop types with `TProps`.
4. Instances should be only used when there is a feature not supported by `Types`.
